# Lane Segmentation with U-Net

This project builds U-Net model (with Focal Loss Function) with Tensorflow and trains it with over 3000 images generated from CARLA simulator. The model achieves mean IOU of 0.8569 and inference time approximately 0.1 second each frame on GPU Tesla T4 on Google Colab. Result below:
